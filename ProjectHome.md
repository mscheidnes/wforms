wForms is an open-source, unobtrusive javascript library that adds commonly needed behaviors to traditional web forms without the need for any programming skill. Supported behaviors are:

  * input validation
  * conditional fields (a.k.a switch/case)
  * repeatable fields (a.k.a one-to-many fields)
  * field hints (a.k.a. tooltips)
  * computed fields (a.k.a. calculations)
  * pseudo multi-page forms (javascript driven)
